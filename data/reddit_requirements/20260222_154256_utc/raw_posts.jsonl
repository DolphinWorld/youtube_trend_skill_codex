{"id": "1rboxrv", "subreddit": "SaaS", "title": "why do so many founders build features nonstop before proving a core customer will actually pay for the product", "selftext": "I built a tiny B2B tool a couple years ago and learned this the hard way. First MVP had signup, a half baked onboarding, and a dashboard I was proud of. I wired up Stripe but left pricing at $0 because I was terrified to ask people for money. So I built more stuff. Zapier integration. An analytics page with Mixpanel. Mobile view. Fancy settings. I spent weeks polishing UI microinteractions while my Intercom inbox filled with users who loved the idea but never converted.\n\nPaid marketing later, crickets. I thought more features would magically create value. Maybe I was naive. Maybe I liked building more than the awkward sales conversations. Also random tangent, my cat once unplugged the staging server and I spent an afternoon debugging CSS while apologizing to early adopters, which I think speaks to priorities.\n\nWhat finally worked was stupid simple and embarrassing. I deleted the free tier, asked three active users to try the paid flow, and watched the signups happen. I stopped building features, and instead watched specific activation events in Mixpanel, read every Intercom convo, and actually asked people, will you pay for this. Turns out they would, for one clear thing, not ten half finished features.\n\nSo why do people keep building first? Fear of rejection maybe. Or the product loop is more fun than the sales grind. Or founders confuse shipping features with progress. I'm not saying I have all the answers, just that this pattern cost me months and a bit of runway.

I'm not where I want to be with Blitztask yet because I want to take my time and enjoy building without making too much stress. I started Blitztask because I wanted to stop overworking myself and think less about \"what do I have to do again?\" and just have a more productive and systematic approach.\n\nSo that's my first post on my journey of building Blitztask! Currently, I'm working on the notifications feature which I'm really excited about because I never worked on such feature. \n\nIf you read this far, thank you for taking your time! From now on, I will try to focus on sharing everything I'm going through building Blitztask, the positives and negatives I'm facing :D\n\n\\*I'm really new to sharing my journey even though I built multiple apps and had multiple projects, I just never shared them so I will have to learn to stick to the topic and not go off topic, sorry for that in advance!", "author": "blitztask", "created_utc": 1771768383.0, "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1rbme7a/my_first_saas_and_how_its_currently_going/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1rbme7a/my_first_saas_and_how_its_currently_going/", "sort_source": "search:need app"}

{"id": "1rblrbi", "subreddit": "SaaS", "title": "My SEO workflow was mass copy-pasting between 5 tabs. So I built an agent that does it instead.", "selftext": "Let me tell you how stupid my process was a year ago.\n\nI'd open Google Search Console in the morning. 10,000 queries staring at me. I'd sort by impressions, try to spot patterns, copy a chunk into Google Sheets. Then open ChatGPT in the next tab. Paste the data. \"What should I optimize?\" And it would give me advice like \"consider improving your meta descriptions and targeting long-tail keywords.\" Thanks. Revolutionary.\n\nSo I'd go back to GSC. Copy another batch. Paste it. \"What about these?\" Same generic answer wearing a different hat. The AI had no idea what my site looked like, what I'd already written, what my internal linking structure was. It was like asking a consultant who's never seen your business to tell you what's wrong with it.\n\nI did this every day. Five tabs open. GSC, Sheets, ChatGPT, my CMS, and whatever article I was referencing. Copy. Paste. Copy. Paste. An hour gone and I had maybe three vague action items I still had to figure out myself.\n\nNow here's the thing. I was already using Claude Code for my actual dev work. Building middleware, writing APIs, shipping features. And I kept noticing how it just does stuff on its own. It calls endpoints. It reads files. It makes decisions. Real agentic behavior, not \"here's a suggestion, good luck.\"\n\nAnd one day I was sitting there copy-pasting GSC data into ChatGPT for the hundredth time and it hit me. Why am I doing this manually when I have an AI that can call APIs on its own?\n\nSo I connected Claude Code to my Google Search Console. Gave it access to my Supabase CMS where all my blog content lives. It already had web search capabilities so it could research topics and check what's ranking. I wrote some knowledge files for context about my site, my goals, my writing style.\n\nAnd suddenly everything changed.\n\nInstead of generic suggestions I was getting complete prioritized lists. Fix this meta title, it's bleeding 4,800 impressions because the keyword isn't in the first 30 characters. This article ranks position 8 for a high volume query but it's targeting the wrong search intent, Google wants a guide not a news piece. Here's a keyword cluster with 2,400 combined impressions and you don't have a dedicated page for it.\n\nSpecific. Data backed. Actionable.\n\nI spent an entire day just following what the agent told me to do. Rewrote meta titles. Fixed intent mismatches. Added FAQ sections. Created new pages for content gaps it identified. Improved internal linking between related articles.\n\nNext morning I checked GSC. Rank 1 on keyword gaps I didn't even know I had. New content clusters I'd completely missed. 68,000 impressions in 9 days. Blog went from 5 impressions per week to 200+ clicks daily.\n\nThe learning curve was insane. Not the tech. The realization of how much I'd been leaving on the table doing SEO the manual way. The data was always there in my Search Console. I just never had something that could actually read all of it, cross reference it with my content, and tell me exactly what to do.\n\nBut then reality set in.\n\nThe knowledge files were a mess. Every new article meant updating markdown files or the agent would give outdated suggestions. Context vanished between sessions. Monday morning the agent had total amnesia about everything it found Friday. OAuth tokens expired silently. Half my time went to maintaining the setup instead of doing actual SEO.\n\nIt worked. But it was duct tape and willpower. Nobody else could use this.\n\nSo I started building it into a real app. Proper OAuth with automatic token refresh that doesn't silently die. A site crawler so the agent reads every page on your site directly instead of me writing markdown descriptions. Persistent memory so it remembers what it found last session. No more amnesia.\n\nThe part that took longest was the writing style system. I wanted the agent to write like me, not like ChatGPT. So I built a pipeline that reads your existing content and generates 6 style files. Tone, structure, sentence patterns, examples, and a banned words list that kills 50+ AI slop phrases. The article writer treats these as rules. Not suggestions. Rules.\n\nI open sourced the whole thing. AGPL-3.0. Figured if it worked for me, other devs might want to self host it.\n\nThey did. The repo got traction. People running it for their blogs. Agencies using it for client sites. PRs coming in.\n\nBut the same feedback kept showing up. \"I love this but I spent 45 minutes setting up Google Cloud OAuth credentials and I still can't get the callback URL right.\" Which is fair. The self hosted setup needs a Google Cloud project, OAuth consent screen, Search Console API enabled, at least one LLM API key, and Node 18+. For a dev that's a Tuesday afternoon. For everyone else it's a wall.\n\nSo now I'm building the hosted version. Same agent. Same 7 tools. Same agentic loop. You sign up, connect your Search Console in one click, and start talking. No local install. No config files. Already have test users running real sites on it.\n\n**What happens when you actually ask it something:**\n\nYou ask \"why is my traffic dropping?\" and the agent doesn't guess. It pulls your GSC data. Finds 15 keywords losing position. Checks your actual page content. Spots thin sections. Cross references internal links. Finds gaps. Up to 5 rounds of tool calls per message. Comes back with a specific diagnosis. Your numbers. Your pages.\n\nAsk it to write an article and it loads your style guide, pulls related keywords from your GSC data, weaves in internal links to your existing pages. Output reads like you wrote it yourself.", "author": "Illustrious-Bug-5593", "created_utc": 1771766614.0, "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1rblrbi/my_seo_workflow_was_mass_copypasting_between_5/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1rblrbi/my_seo_workflow_was_mass_copypasting_between_5/", "sort_source": "search:looking for tool"}

Figured I'd share the breakdown since I wish someone had done this for me.  \n  \n  \n**Hiring real influencers**  \n  \n  \nEven at the bottom of the barrel — nano-influencers with like 1-10k followers — you're looking at $200-500 for a single TikTok or Reel. That's one video. And it's not like you just pay and get a video the next day. There's the back and forth on scripts, revisions, waiting for them to actually film it... I was quoted 1-2 weeks turnaround by most of them.  \n  \n  \nMicro-influencers (10k-100k) want $500-2,000 per video. And if you go through an agency? Don't even look unless you have $5-10k minimum to spend on a campaign package.  \n  \n  \nFor a pre-revenue SaaS? Absolutely not.  \n  \n  \n**DIY / filming yourself**  \n  \n  \n\"Just film it on your phone, it's free!\" Sure. Except it takes me like 4-8 hours per video when you add up scripting, setting up decent lighting, filming, re-filming because I keep looking at the wrong spot, editing, and then doing it all again because the audio sounded weird. And also, I don't like to show my face!  \n  \n  \nAt any reasonable founder hourly rate ($100-200/hr), that \"free\" video costs $400-1,600 in opportunity cost. Plus I genuinely don't want to be the face of my company on TikTok. Some founders love it. I'm not one of them.  \n  \n  \n**AI UGC video tools**  \n  \nThis is where I spent most of my research time. There are actually a bunch of tools now that generate UGC-style videos with AI influencers:  \n  \n  \n\\- Arcads charges about $11 per video ($110 for 10). Most polished output I found but also the priciest  \n\\- Linah is about $10 per video ($99 for 10). Premium positioning  \n\\- MakeUGC runs about $6.90 per video ($49 for 5 videos). Solid middle ground  \n\\- TopView is the budget option at $16-18/month but the quality is noticeably lower  \n  \n  \nThe premium ones ($7-11/video) are still 20-50x cheaper than real influencers, which is wild.

{"id": "1ranq73", "subreddit": "SaaS", "title": "Are Google Ads agencies actually dead or am I just salty?", "selftext": "So context. I run a SaaS in the time management space and I've probably wasted somewhere in the region of $40-50k on running my own ads and then some shit agencies over the last years that I'd rather not think about too hard. So take everything below with that grain of salt because I'm genuinely not sure if I've landed on a real framework or just a way of rationalising my own journey. Also I realise it's not that much ad spend in the grand scheme of things.\n\nHere's how I've come to think about it though.\n\n**Under $500/month**\n\nAt this level agencies aren't the answer, but not because agencies are bad. It's just the economics make no sense for either side. If you're putting $200-300 into actual ad spend, any management fee worth charging is going to eat a massive chunk of that.\n\nYou're better off just learning. Google Skillshop is free, YouTube has genuinely solid stuff that'll get you 80% of the way there. I wish someone had just told me this clearly at the start instead of letting me find out the expensive way.\n\n**$500-$10,000**\n\nThis is where I think the tradtional \"just hire an agency\" answer breaks down most. Because there ARE agencies that will take you at this level, but in my experiance the cheaper ones are mostly running semi-automated campaigns with very little actual strategic thinking behind them. You're not getting a senior person on your account. You're getting a template and a monthly call where they read your dashboard back to you.\n\nThere are alternatives that I think are genuinely worth looking at here though. I played around with Adalytics for a bit which I thought was pretty decent for getting real visibility on where spend is actually going and whether it's being wasted.\n\nThere's the SaaS Ad Studio is another one that sits in this space, it's more of a guided \"do it yourself with structure\" model rather than full handover and uses a bunch of AI. Obviously there's 50 others beyond these few too.\n\nThe point is the gap between \"winging it alone\" and \"paying $1,000/month in fees on a $1,500 spend\" has a lot more options in it now than it did a few years ago.\n\n**$10,000+ is where I think agencies genuinely still win and I'll die on this hill**\n\nA good agency has people who literally live inside ad accounts all day. Across 10, 15, 20 different clients, constantly talking to each other about what's working. That collective pattern recognition across accounts is just hard to replicate when you're running your own one campaign and learning from your own one data set.\n\nWhen you're at $15-20k/month the difference between a CPA of $400 and $800 is not a rounding error. That gap is exactly where a great agency versus a mediocre one (or a well-meaning founder doing it themselves between everything else they have to do) shows up. The maths just work at that scale in a way they don't lower down.\n\nAnyway that's my rough take, could easily be wrong especially on the middle bracket.

Keeping agents reliable when you chain 10 different tools together is where everyone falls apart. Every competitor demos the happy path. Nobody shows you what happens when things go wrong. That's the gap.\n\nTalking to potential users before having anything to show felt uncomfortable. But it already completely changed what I'm prioritising. Features I was convinced were essential turned out to be irrelevant. Problems I hadn't even thought about turned out to be the whole reason someone would pay.\n\nThe \"crowded market\" thing falls apart fast when you actually use the existing tools.

A few went on to build real companies. The vast majority quietly faded away. Watching this cycle repeat teaches you to see the startup world exactly as it is without the usual romance.\n\nMost people are not building a business. They are building a safe room. They spend months agonizing over the perfect tech stack, a beautiful landing page, or gathering a waitlist. They do this because as long as they are just preparing, they cannot be rejected. It is a way to feel productive while completely avoiding reality.\n\nThe truth is the market is entirely indifferent to your effort. It does not care how many sleepless nights you had or how clean your architecture is. It only responds to utility. If your product does not solve a pain someone is willing to pay for today, your effort means nothing. This is not cruel. It is simply a fact.\nFounders suffer because they tie their ego to their product. When the market is silent they take it as a personal failure. But your code is not you. A failed launch is not a tragedy. It is just the market giving you data. The only rational response is to accept that data, detach your emotions from the outcome, and move on to the next iteration.\n\nIf you have not asked a user for money yet, you do not have a startup. You have an expensive hobby. Stop looking for validation in praise and upvotes. Seek the clear and neutral signal of a transaction, and let go of everything else.\n\nEdit - Since a few people asked in the comments and DMs, yes I do take on client work.

I was constantly checking the markets trying to keep up with my competitors. What is their pricing, did they drop a new feature I have to match, how are their pages structured, what keywords should I push, what are the best sources for backlinks etc. At the end, I spent arround 2-3 hours weekly just to fill out my google sheets and compare my SaaS with others.

By sharing a story instead, you earn those early upvotes.\n\n3. Let Them Ask (The Comment Drop)\n\nIf your story is actually good and solves a real pain point, the community will naturally ask in the comments: \"This sounds exactly like what I need, do you have a link?\" That is when you drop the link.\n\nTo the moderators, it just looks like a helpful founder answering a genuine question from the community.

I'd end the day busy but not productive. Exhausted but not fulfilled. There's a real difference between the two, and I was consistently landing on the wrong side of it.\n\nThe shift happened when I stopped asking \"What do I need to do today?\" and started asking \"What is the ONE thing I must do today?\" That tiny word swap changed everything. It forced me to make a decision before the day made one for me. It turned a to-do list into a declaration of intent.\n\nNow, every morning before the phone, before the noise, before the world starts pulling me in seventeen directions; I sit down, I write it out, and I commit to it. Some days that one thing is a career move. Some days it's a difficult conversation I've been avoiding. Some days it's rest, because rest is also productive when you need it.\n\nWhat I've noticed is that when you protect one priority fiercely, everything else either falls into place around it or reveals itself as less urgent than you thought.\n\nSo I'm genuinely curious.... what question do you ask yourself in the morning to stay grounded and motivated? Is it about gratitude? Goals? Energy?

{"id": "1pj2arp", "subreddit": "productivity", "title": "Life is Soo Dull for Me.. What Should I Do..", "selftext": "Hi, I’m 18.\n\nA little backstory: I left my previous school about a year ago, and I’ve been studying in a new school since then. Today I realized something… When I look back on my life, I feel like I haven’t really achieved anything. Eighteen years, and nothing to show for it.\n\nI made around 6–7 friends from class 4 to class 12, but in this last year not a single one contacted me. I’m still in their group chat — they haven’t removed me — but whenever I try to talk, more than half the time they ignore me. Maybe I’m annoying, maybe I’m not that “brother from another mother” type of friend. I made so many memories with them, but looking back, I see that I was mostly just tagging along… changing myself to fit in. And even then, they only talked to me formally.\n\nI was good at studies — maybe they didn’t like that, I don’t know. When I look at the memories, either they used me or I never truly felt connected. My birthday was last month, and no one wished me. Literally no one. In previous years we had parties, Instagram posts, everything. But this time? Nothing.\n\nMaybe I also played a part in all this. At home I usually spent all my time studying, while they spent theirs on Instagram, reels, trends… They watch 100 reels a day. I couldn’t keep up, so I stopped watching them, and slowly I became like an alien in conversations. Maybe that’s why things changed.\n\nAs for my parents… I don’t know what to say. They act fine when my marks are good, but if my marks aren’t “good enough,” they get angry or hit me. They’re never happy with my results. The exam I’m preparing for is almost impossible to score perfectly in — no one gets full marks — but whenever the results come, they only ask where marks got cut. Even when I’m proud of myself, they demotivate me. If I get rank 1 in my institute, they say, “There are 10 more institutes with 10 more branches, so work harder.”\n\nSo I started feeling like I’ve achieved nothing. My looks and height bother me — I’m 5'7 and I don’t think I look good. I lost confidence because girls in my class made fun of my voice for being too deep. So today I realized I have nothing: no good looks, no height, no “natural” qualities, no close friends, no one who cares, no achievements, no confidence, no certificates, nothing. It feels like I wasted 18 years.\n\nBut I don’t want sympathy. I already know I’m the worst and I hate myself. I want **truth**, not sugarcoating. I want to know: **Should I give up?** Not on life — I won’t do that, no matter how hard things get. I mean should I give up on *happiness*…? Should I stop expecting anything from people and just accept life completely?\n\nSometimes I think about becoming like a monk — accepting everything, expecting nothing, being peaceful. But when I try to accept everything, I become emotionless. I know stoicism isn’t about being emotionless, that’s something else, but you get what I mean: accepting pain, accepting whatever life gives, not expecting anything. The problem is that when you accept everything, colors fade from life. Then what’s the point? Is peace worth losing all feeling?\n\nI feel like if I accept everything, I’ll just keep moving forward, exploring the world and its traditions, but without emotion. So tell me… is that the right way to live?   \nin Short Should I give up expecting from life and Start enjoying life alone and whatever I want ( ofcource I gonna Try hard and make it best.. )", "author": "Ok-Reflection-391", "created_utc": 1765372573.0, "score": 3, "num_comments": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1pj2arp/life_is_soo_dull_for_me_what_should_i_do/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1pj2arp/life_is_soo_dull_for_me_what_should_i_do/", "sort_source": "search:wish there was"}

This thing honestly helped me alot in the past 7days", "selftext": "So.. it was a random day and suddenly something in mind spoke out. I didn’t plan this. I wasn’t trying to “fix my life” or run some challenge. I just needed structure because everything felt scattered\n\nI just randomly realised how much I scattered my own life being the 'old me'. Started a buisness but didn't took it seriously. All I did in the past 11months is switching from this to that. First Ebooks selling. Then notion templates. Then AI automation DIY blueprints. Then AI agents. Then Ads(using gemini) for skincare brands and what not. I made $0. Not because the niche was wrong or something. But it was my 'efforts' who made it impossible. I learnt over this time that nothing worked because I didn't sticked to them long enough.\nThen I ended up in Meta Recovery Path Report(AI assisted). Noone on reddit was providing this(except scammers). Meta(the owner company of Instagram-Facebook-Whatsapp) banned thousands of accounts per day for no reason(they left everything to their AI and it false banned many). I helped them understood the reason behind their ban. I made $96.7 in profit in 20days. Then again, the lazyness strike. I felt like I did too much and then started resting. Which obviously lead to fall out of the buisness and life.\nI am an teenager who started the hustle alone for my dreams. When I realised what a downfall I made trying to 'rest' my body. I sat on my chair. Opened the laptop and started searching on internet to get productive and like everyone here failed by searching there(I am sorry if I am wrong), I failed too. So I mapped out my own behaviour and common human behaviour. Then went on the web and changed my search from 'How to get productive' to 'How dopamine in humans works' - 'The reason and side effects of procastination' - 'How willpower works', etc. Then listened to 3-4 book summaries (deep work, atomic habit, etc) and made a planer that allowed me to start right at the moment.\n\nWhat I did:\n•Implemented methods in the plan to make me feel happy and rewarded for every important task.\n•Kept my brain into a state where procastination was not an option\n•Listed some important tasks and breaked them down into micro tasks which seems like won't make any difference but when they compounded over time, they do made a big difference (it's a one line summary of 'Atomic Habits' book)\nAnd 7more points which I can't list here cause.. they are pretty long compared to these three.\n\nIn 7days, I stabled my buisness again, Didn't ace in tests but made it to 87% average, burned more calories (running and calesthenics) and some more improvements. I am not saying it will turn me into a millionaire in the next 30days.. or I got shredded in just 2weeks with this planner or any BS like that. Good things take time. And BTW, I also started selling ebooks(made $49 days in 3days). I started selling the planner I made for myself and honestly people liked it.\n\nI am not promoting here anything. I am just sharing what helps.\n\nAdvice: I know we all thought that if I started being disciplined, I will get results fast or I will become the man I want to in a short period. Ans that's why we drop it when our efforts don't seem to make the chages we want. If you think being disciplined will get me shredded in the next 30days, and you start working out with motivation but after 30days, when the result doesn't seem to appear. You drop it. And the hard truth is that most people including me can't even stick to GYM for 30days(that's why I started this small for now). But yeah, you will get into a good physique in the next 1.5-2 years.

So, I have two big roles, and by the end of the day, I am usually exhausted beyond my limits.\n\nSo, I counted (old school, with a pencil, in my work notebook) how many decisions I have to make in a single day. Not big dramatic decisions.

I blamed the gloomy weather or accumulated tiredness. Turns out, it wasn’t laziness. My brain was just out of decision fuel. So instead of trying to push through with more discipline, I changed the environment so I had fewer choices to make (based on recs from these three books -  *‘Willpower’* by Roy Baumeister, *‘Essentialism’* by Greg McKeown, and *‘Atomic Habits’* by James Clear).\n\nWhat helped most:\n\n* **Sameness over variety:** same breakfast rotation, basic “uniform” clothes, a default dinner plan. If it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t get a fresh decision daily.\n* **Batch decisions:** Slack at set times, project check-ins twice a day, one planning block. This killed the constant background “should I check?” loop.\n* **\"I'll think about it tomorrow\" approach:** after \\~5 PM, I don’t decide anything non-urgent. I park it for morning when my brain is reset.\n* **Buy things that I like x3:** I bought 3 pairs of same jeans, mesh shoes and T-shirts in multiple colors. So, now I don't have to go shopping in the next 5 years, lol.\n\nOne small thing that also reduced friction: for learning/reading, I stopped forcing myself to commit to full books when I was already fried. I’ll skim a 10–15 min summary first (I use Headway for that) and only go deeper if it’s clearly worth it.\n\nIf you try one experiment: track every decision until 5 PM for one day.

What I do is I choose a map of country/region by just finding some maps without text online or draw your own. Then I print (you don't have to print it you can also just color image in painting software) like 6 of them for a week and in each section/region of the map write down a thing I need to accomplish to color it. You can also only do a task that borders region that you already filled. I found a number of benefits to this:\n\n\n\nPerfectly limits choice. By this one I mean that it gives you choice but not so much that you get frustrated by choosing what to do and helps to avoid avoiding some tasks as you might be in situation where you can't advance unless you complete some of those tasks.\n\n\n\nLeverages perfectionism as you want to color map.\n\n\n\nGives a bit creativity as you can choose what shape to make on the map.\n\n\n\nCan be in your favorite color. You can color map in any color\n\n\n\nGamification! Many people enjoy strategy games and it maybe mainly because of coloring maps as suggested by interesting video \"What people don't get about strategy games\" (won't put link here to not breach rules but I think if you need it you can find it)\n\n\n\nNarrative/imagination. You can use imagination to say that for example that it takes you so long to complete one small region is because there is harsh terrain or fortress\n\n\n\nFeel free to ask any questions if you find it interesting!", "author": "IllIaLime", "created_utc": 1771555287.0, "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r9jgnu/i_found_this_technique_well_kind_of_technique/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1r9jgnu/i_found_this_technique_well_kind_of_technique/", "sort_source": "search:any software for"}
